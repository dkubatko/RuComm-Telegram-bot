Welcome to the mafia, {0} üòé

Here is a brief description of what I do:
I notify all our members about upcoming events to make sure \
that the mafia grows steadily.

- What do I do next?

You can check out ongoing /events, but otherwise - nothing really!
Just pay attention to notifications from me in order to stay connected.

We hope to to see you on our next event where we can ü§ôüëå‚úäü§´

Thank you for joining the Russian Mafia!

Contribute on <a href="https://github.com/dkubatko/Russian-Mafia-Telegram-bot">@github/dkubatko</a>

Note: If you see your name as "None", make sure you set up a username in Telegram and run /start again.

P.S.: I <i>do</i> have secrets. ü§ê
